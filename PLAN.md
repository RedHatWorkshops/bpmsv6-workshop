# Proposed plan of action

Create a hands-on workshop on multiple labs that anyone can walk through to get started with BPMSuite v6 and explore common use cases. 

Labs should include cut and paste-able code and configuration information to allow for completion.

Each lab should contain in Markdown format
* Overview summary of what topic will be covered in this lab
* Assumptions and Pre-requistes needed before starting this lab
* Step by Step instructions to complete the lab
* Review of what the lab showed the participant
* Where to find more information - links
